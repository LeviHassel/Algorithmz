# isPalindrome

## Overview
isPalindrome is a function that takes one string as input and returns a Boolean value. isPalindrome returns true if the word is a palindrome (read the same forwards as backwards), and false otherwise.

## Requirements
This can be run on any system with **g++** (included in GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection) or with any IDE that supports C++, though my directions on how to run it are for the former.

## How to Run
Download the code and navigate to the directory.

Compile the program with the command: `g++ -o run.me *.cpp` (note that you can name `run.me` whatever you choose)

Run the executable with this command:
`./run.me`

If you wish to change the input, open up *tests.cpp* and edit line 7.
