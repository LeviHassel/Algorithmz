# printPermutations

## Overview
printPermutations is a function that takes one string as input and print out the unique permutations of that string in lexicographic (alphabetical) order. This assumes that the string is already in lexicographic order.

## Requirements
This can be run on any system with **g++** (included in GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection) or with any IDE that supports C++, though my directions on how to run it are for the former.

## How to Run
Download the code and navigate to the directory.

Compile the program with the command: `g++ -o run.me *.cpp` (note that you can name `run.me` whatever you choose)

Run the executable with this command:
`./run.me word`, where "word" is a string of your choice

The program will print all permutations for whatever string you enter.
