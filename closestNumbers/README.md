# closestNumbers

## Overview
closestNumbers takes one argument: a vector of double values. The function returns the distance between the two closest numbers. This assumes that the vector is in ascending order.

## Requirements
This can be run on any system with **g++** (included in GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection) or with any IDE that supports C++, though my directions on how to run it are for the former.

## How to Run
Download the code and navigate to the directory.

Compile the program with the command: `g++ -o run.me *.cpp` (note that you can name `run.me` whatever you choose)

Run the executable with this command:
`./run.me test1.numbers.input`

If you wish to change the input, simply edit *test1.numbers.input*.
