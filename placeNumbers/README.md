# placeNumbers

## Overview
placeNumbers is a function that takes a vector of n integers and a vector of n-1 Boolean values as input and returns a vector of n integers. placeNumbers returns an ordering of the numbers such that the conditions encoded in the vector of Boolean values are met. A value in the Boolean vector is true if the number that would be to its left is less than the right that would be to its right, and false otherwise. This function assumes that the vector is in ascending order.

## Requirements
These can be run on a Linux system with **g++**.

## How to Run
Compile the code with the command:
`g++ -o /path/to/executable.out /path/to/source/files/*.cpp`

And then run the executable.
