# minSteps

## Overview
minSteps is a function that, given a vector of integer values (representing stride lengths) and an integer (representing an exact distance to cover), returns the minimum number of steps needed to travel that exact distance. It can be assumed that the vector of stride lengths will be provided in ascending order of length.

## Requirements
These can be run on a Linux system with **g++**.

## How to Run
Compile the code with the command:
`g++ -o /path/to/executable.out /path/to/source/files/*.cpp`

And then run the executable.
