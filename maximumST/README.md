# maximumST

## Overview
maximumST is a function that takes an n x n vector (representing the adjacency matrix of a graph) as input and returns the value of the maximum spanning tree of the graph defined by the n x n vector.

## Requirements
This can be run on any system with **g++** (included in GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection) or with any IDE that supports C++, though my directions on how to run it are for the former.

## How to Run
Download the code and navigate to the directory.

Compile the program with the command (note that you can name `run.me` whatever you choose):
`g++ -o run.me *.cpp`

Run the executable with this command:
`./run.me test1.matrix.input`

If you wish to change the input, simply edit *test1.matrix.input*.
