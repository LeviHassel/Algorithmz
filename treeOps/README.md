# treeOps

## Overview
This project contains a definition for MyTree, a specific binary tree and many related functions, such as ones for inserting and deleting nodes and rotating the tree left and right. It assumes that only positive values will be placed into the MyTree.

## Requirements
These can be run on a Linux system with **g++**.

## How to Run
Compile the code with the command:
`g++ -o /path/to/executable.out /path/to/source/files/*.cpp`

And then run the executable.
You may modify the test values in order to see different results.
