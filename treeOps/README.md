# treeOps

## Overview
This project contains a definition for MyTree, a specific binary tree and many related functions, such as ones for inserting and deleting nodes and rotating the tree left and right. It assumes that only positive values will be placed into the MyTree.

## Requirements
This can be run on any system with **g++** (included in GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection) or with any IDE that supports C++, though my directions on how to run it are for the former.

## How to Run
Download the code and navigate to the directory.

Compile the program with the command (note that you can name `run.me` whatever you choose):
`g++ -o run.me *.cpp`

Run the executable with this command:
`./run.me`

If you wish to change the input, simply edit *tests.cpp* using the functions defined in *treeOps.cpp*.
