# maxProfit

## Overview
maxProfit is a function that, given a vector of n execution times (in seconds), n deadlines (in seconds), and n profits (in dollars) for on-time completion, should return the greatest profit for executing the n jobs, given these constraints: once started, a job must run to completion. If a job is completed after its deadline, its profit is $0. You want to schedule the jobs in a way that maximizes the profit.

## Requirements
These can be run on a Linux system with **g++**.

## How to Run
Compile the code with the command:
`g++ -o /path/to/executable.out /path/to/source/files/*.cpp`

And then run the executable.
